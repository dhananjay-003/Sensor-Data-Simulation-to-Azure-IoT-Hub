# Sensor-Data-Simulation-to-Azure-IoT-Hub
This project simulates sensor data (temperature, humidity, and pressure) and sends it to Azure IoT Hub for cloud-based monitoring. The data is also stored in Azure Table Storage for persistence. It's a demonstration of real-time IoT data simulation and storage using Python and Azure services.
